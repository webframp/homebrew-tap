# Homebrew tap

A personal homebrew [tap](https://docs.brew.sh/Taps) for software I may need
that doesnâ€™t qualify for upstream inclusion in
[homebrew-core](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core) for one reason or another.

## Tools

- [ec2-instance-connect-cli](https://github.com/aws/aws-ec2-instance-connect-cli)
- some [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/) extensions
- [spotifyd](https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd)
